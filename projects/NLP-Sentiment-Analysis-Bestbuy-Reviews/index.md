## Project Workflow and Importance

Understanding customer sentiment is crucial for **improving service quality and customer satisfaction**. The workflow includes:

1. **Data Collection** – Fetch reviews from Trustpilot, handling multiple pages efficiently.  
2. **Data Storage** – Store all reviews in **MongoDB** for persistent access.  
3. **Data Cleaning** – Preprocess text to remove noise and bias.  
4. **Sentiment Analysis** – Apply multiple models and evaluate performance.  
5. **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** – Extract sentiment per service aspect.  
6. **Topic Modeling & Clustering** – Identify hidden themes in reviews.  
7. **Sentiment Trends Over Time** – Visualize changes in sentiment.

This workflow ensures a **comprehensive understanding of customer feedback**, helping businesses identify key issues and make **data-driven decisions**.

## 3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Text preprocessing prepares the reviews for accurate sentiment analysis:

- Convert all text to **lowercase**.  
- Replace mentions of "BestBuy" with a neutral placeholder (**COMPANY**) to **avoid bias**.  
- Remove **punctuation** and irrelevant characters.  
- Filter out **stopwords** to retain meaningful words.

This ensures the sentiment analysis focuses on the **actual content of customer feedback**.

## 4️⃣ Sentiment Analysis

Three models were used:

- **TextBlob** – rule-based model.  
- **DistilBERT SST-2** – transformer-based classifier.  
- **Multilingual BERT** – the most accurate model.

**Performance of Multilingual BERT:**  

| Metric      | Score  |
|------------|--------|
| **Accuracy**   | 92%    |
| **Precision**  | 0.62   |
| **Recall**     | 0.53   |
| **F1-score**   | 0.52   |

**Explanation of Metrics:**  
- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct predictions.  
- **Precision:** Fraction of predicted positives that are correct.  
- **Recall:** Fraction of actual positives correctly identified.  
- **F1-score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
