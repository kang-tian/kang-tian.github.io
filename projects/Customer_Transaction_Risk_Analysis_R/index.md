# Customer Transaction & Risk Analysis Project (R)

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to perform a comprehensive **customer transaction analysis** on a banking dataset. The objective is to understand customer behaviors, identify potential risk factors, and build predictive models that can help the bank make informed lending decisions. The workflow includes **data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, RFM analysis, modeling, and evaluation**.

---

## 2. Data Description
The dataset contains information about bank clients and their credit status. It includes:

- **Client Information:** Age, job type, marital status, education, etc.
- **Financial Indicators:** Credit amount, duration, and previous defaults.
- **Target Variable:** Credit risk outcome (good or bad).

The dataset consists of both **numerical and categorical variables**, which requires proper preprocessing before modeling.

---

## 3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Data cleaning involves:

- Handling missing values by imputation or removal.
- Converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).
- Correcting inconsistent or erroneous entries.
- Ensuring the dataset is in a consistent format for further analysis.

This step ensures that the models receive **accurate and clean data** to learn from.

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps in understanding **data distributions and relationships**:

- Distribution of credit amounts and durations.
- Customer demographics analysis (age, job type, marital status).
- Correlation between financial indicators and credit risk.

Observations from EDA provide insights into **patterns and anomalies** that could affect model performance.

## 5. Handling Missing Values
Missing data can bias model results. Typical strategies include:

- **Numerical Columns:** Filling with mean or median.
- **Categorical Columns:** Filling with the mode or a special category like "Unknown".
- **Dropping Rows:** Only if missing values are minimal and not critical.

Proper handling ensures **robustness and reliability** in modeling.

---

## 6. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering creates new variables to improve model performance:

- Deriving ratios like **credit amount per month**.
- Combining categorical variables for interaction effects.
- Encoding temporal variables to capture trends.
- Creating **risk indicators** based on customer history.

These engineered features often capture **latent patterns** not obvious in raw data.

---

## 7. Data Transformation
Data transformation prepares features for modeling:

- Normalization or standardization of numerical variables.
- Encoding categorical features with one-hot or label encoding.
- Reducing dimensionality if necessary (e.g., PCA).

Transformed data ensures **models converge faster** and perform better.

---

## 8. RFM Analysis
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis evaluates **customer behavior patterns**:

- **Recency (R):** How recently the customer interacted with the bank or took a loan.
- **Frequency (F):** How often the customer engages or takes loans.
- **Monetary (M):** The amount of money involved in their transactions.

By scoring each customer on R, F, and M, we can segment them into **risk groups**:

- High R, F, M → Loyal, active, and potentially low-risk customers.
- Low R, F, M → Dormant or high-risk customers.
- Mixed scores → Moderate engagement or targeted intervention needed.

RFM segmentation provides an **additional perspective on credit risk**, supplementing traditional features.

## 9. Data Visualization
Visualization helps communicate findings:

- Bar plots for categorical variable distributions.
- Histograms and boxplots for numerical variables.
- Heatmaps for correlations.
- Trend plots over time for customer engagement.

Effective visualizations make patterns **easier to interpret and act upon**.

---

## 10. Modeling
Modeling involves **predicting credit risk** using various algorithms:

- **Logistic Regression:** Baseline model for binary classification.
- **Decision Trees / Random Forest:** Captures non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
- **Gradient Boosting / XGBoost:** Often yields high accuracy on tabular data.
- **Neural Networks:** For capturing complex patterns in large datasets.

Models are trained on **historical data** and tested on unseen samples.

---

## 11. Model Evaluation
Evaluation metrics measure model performance:

- **Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly predicted credit outcomes.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score:** For imbalanced classes, especially high-risk loans.
- **ROC-AUC:** Measures the ability to distinguish between good and bad credit.

Visualizations like **confusion matrices and ROC curves** help interpret model quality.

Evaluation ensures the model is **reliable and generalizable** for future predictions.
